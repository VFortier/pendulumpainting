# Ideas

- Background
-- Perlin noise "cloudy"
-- Perlin flowfield using short lived particle to draw strikes of paint (try color very close to plain background underneat)
- Create other drawing modes
-- With splashes
-- With line with darked center
- Start new pendulum button (to draw many pendulum on one frame)
- Gallery : Option to draw on one or many "frame"
-- Shadow around canvas to show elevation
-- Paint only appears on frame



- Workshop : Option to draw canvas being on top of a floor.
-- Shadow around canvas to show elevation
-- Slight change in color when paint lands on the floor
-- Messy floor with lots of paint would be nice
