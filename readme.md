# Ideas

- Change color mode to HSL
- "Init" with button + bind to "r"
- Background
-- Perlin noise "cloudy"
-- Perlin flowfield using short lived particle to draw strikes of paint (try color very close to plain background underneat)
- Canvas swinging in pendulum
- Create other drawing modes
-- With vertex
-- With splashes
-- With line with darked center
- Gallery : Option to draw on one or many "frame"
-- Shadow around canvas to show elevation
-- Paint only appears on frame



- Workshop : Option to draw canvas being on top of a floor.
-- Shadow around canvas to show elevation
-- Slight change in color when paint lands on the floor
-- Messy floor with lots of paint would be nice
